# Dynamic-DC-Load
DIY Dynamic DC Load

This joint project with Bud Bennett has the details to build a DC Dynamic Load with some special features.

The instrument specifications are:
  
  • Input voltage: 1..100VDC.
  
  • Reverse polarity protection to -100V and a 10A fuse.
  
  • DUT is disconnected by a relay for invalid inputs like reverse polarity.
  
  • Maximum current of 10A @ 40V
  
  • Maximum power 180W @25 degrees ambient temperature
  
  • Volt Accuracy: 0.3%
  
  • Current Accuracy: 0.4%
  
  • Maximum power 180W @25 degrees ambient temperature (heatsink temp 85C)
  
  • Off state DUT current 1.9uA at 2V, 57.7uA at 60V.
  
  • Power input: 12VDC Wall-wart 0.5A with reverse polarity protection to -24V and PTC fuse
  
  • CC, CV and battery modes with hardware real-time operation.
  
  • CP and CR modes have active software regulation (resolution +/-156uA).
  
  • Pulse/transient mode supported by an external Function Generator. 5V=10A
  
  • Current monitoring with a DSO. 1V=10A
  
  • GUI: 128x128 OLED 1.5' color display and a rotary encoder with a dual button functions.
  
  • Two temperature controlled fans.
  
  • Protection for over voltage, over current, over power and over temperature limits
  
  • Overall dimensions: 21cm long, 18cm wide and a height of 118cm.
  
  • Weight: approx. 1110 grams
