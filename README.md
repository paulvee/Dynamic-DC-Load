# Dynamic-DC-Load
DIY Dynamic DC Load

This joint project with Bud Bennett has the details to build a DC Dynamic Load with some special features.

The instrument specifications are:
  
  • Input voltage: 1..100VDC.
  
  • Reverse polarity protection to -100V and a 10A fuse.
  
  • DUT is disconnected by a relays for invalid inputs like reverse polarity.
  
  • Maximum current of 10A @ 40V
  
  • Maximum power 180W @25 degrees ambient temperature
  
  • Volt Accuracy: 0.2%
  
  • Current Accuracy: 0.6%
  
  • Power input: 12VDC Wall-wart 0.5A with reverse polarity protection to -24V and PTC fuse
  
  • CC & CV modes with real-time operation, CP, CR and Battery Mode supported in software.
  
  • Pulse/transient mode supported by an external Function Generator. 5V=10A
  
  • Current monitoring with a DSO. 1V=10A
  
  • GUI: 128x128 OLED 1.5' color display and a rotary encoder with a dual button functions.
  
  • Two temperature controlled fans.
  
  • Overall dimensions: 21cm long, 18cm wide and a height of 118cm.
  
  • Weight: approx. 1110 grams
